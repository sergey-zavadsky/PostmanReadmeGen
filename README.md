# PostmanReadmeGen

PostmanReadmeGen is a tool that generates documentation from Postman collections into README files. It creates two sections within the README:

1. **Summary**: A concise summary of the Postman collection.
2. **Detailed**: This section includes detailed information from the collection.

## Installation

To get started, import `generateTrees` and provide a folder with your Postman collections.

```javascript
import { generateTrees } from 'postmanreadmegen';
generateTrees('collection');
```

Then simply run `node yourfile.js`.
